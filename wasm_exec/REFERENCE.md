# wasm_exec reference

This package contains imports and state needed by wasm go compiles when
`GOOS=js` and `GOARCH=wasm`.

## Introduction

When `GOOS=js` and `GOARCH=wasm`, Go's compiler targets WebAssembly 1.0 Binary
format (%.wasm).

Ex.
```bash
$ GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o my.wasm .
```

The operating system is "js", but more specifically it is [wasm_exec.js][1].
This package runs the `%.wasm` just like `wasm_exec.js` would.

## Identifying wasm compiled by Go

If you have a `%.wasm` file compiled by Go (via [asm.go][2]), it has a custom
section named "go.buildid".

You can verify this with wasm-objdump, a part of [wabt][3]:
```
$ wasm-objdump --section=go.buildid -x my.wasm

example3.wasm:  file format wasm 0x1

Section Details:

Custom:
- name: "go.buildid"
```

## Module Exports

Until [wasmexport][4] is implemented, the [compiled][2] WebAssembly exports are
always the same:

* "mem" - (memory 265) 265 = data section plus 16MB
* "run" - (func (param $argc i32) (param $argv i32)) the entrypoint
* "resume" - (func) continues work after a timer delay
* "getsp" - (func (result i32)) returns the stack pointer

## Module Imports

Go's [compiles][3] all WebAssembly imports in the module "go", and only
functions are imported.

Except for the "debug" function, all function names are prefixed by their go
package. Here are the defaults:

* "debug" - is always function index zero, but it has unknown use.
* "runtime.*" - supports system-call like functionality `GOARCH=wasm`
* "syscall/js.*" - supports the JavaScript model `GOOS=js`

### syscall/js

"syscall/js.*" are host functions for managing the JavaScript object graph,
including functions to make and finalize objects, arrays and numbers
(`js.Value`).

Each `js.Value` has a `js.ref`, which is either a numeric literal or an object
reference depending on its 64-bit bit pattern. When an object, the first 31
bits are its identifier.

Details beyond this are best looking at the source code of [js.go][5], or its
unit tests.

## PC_B calling conventions

The assembly `CallImport` instruction doesn't compile signatures to WebAssembly
function types, invoked by the `call` instruction.

Instead, the compiler generates the same signature for all functions: a single
parameter of the stack pointer, and invokes them via `call.indirect`.

Specifically, any function compiled with `CallImport` has the same function
type: `(func (param $sp i32))`. `$sp` is the base memory offset to read and
write parameters to the stack (at 8 byte strides even if the value is 32-bit).

So, implementors need to read the actual parameters from memory. Similarly, if
there are results, the implementation must write those to memory.

For example, `func walltime() (sec int64, nsec int32)` writes its results to
memory at offsets `sp+8` and `sp+16` respectively.

## Go-defined exported functions

[Several functions][6] differ in calling convention by using WebAssembly type
signatures instead of the single SP parameter summarized above. Functions used
by the host have a "wasm_export_" prefix, which is stripped. For example,
"wasm_export_run" is exported as "run", defined in [rt0_js_wasm.s][7]

Here is an overview of the Go-defined exported functions:
 * "run" - Accepts "argc" and "argv" i32 params and begins the "wasm_pc_f_loop"
 * "resume" - Nullary function that resumes execution until it needs an event.
 * "getsp" - Returns the i32 stack pointer (SP)

Note: the "wasm_export_" prefix is stripped. For example, "wasm_export_run"
becomes the WebAssembly export "run".

## User-defined Host Functions

Users can define their own "go" module function imports by defining a func
without a body in their source and a `%_wasm.s` or `%_js.s` file that uses the
`CallImport` instruction.

For example, given `func logString(msg string)` and the below assembly:
```assembly
#include "textflag.h"

TEXT Â·logString(SB), NOSPLIT, $0
CallImport
RET
```

If the package was `main`, the WebAssembly function name would be
"main.logString". If it was `util` and your `go.mod` module was
"github.com/user/me", the WebAssembly function name would be
"github.com/user/me/util.logString".

Regardless of whether the function import was built-in to Go, or defined by an
end user, all imports use `CallImport` conventions. Since these compile to a
signature unrelated to the source, more care is needed implementing the host
side, to ensure the proper count of parameters are read and results written to
the Go stack.
